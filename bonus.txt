## Logging:
    Added a global logger.
    Used to push logs with levels:
        - INFO
        - WARNING
        - FATAL
    When FATAL terminates the program, used for unrecoverable cases.
    log file is `vacuum_cleaner.log`. Resets on every run.

## Visualization:
    uses standard output to visualize the robot's travel in the house.
    Shows the deferent modes of the robot (moving, cleaning and charging).
    Shows battery level and remaning steps.
    Adds walls around the house - they do not appear in the house representation of the simulator, they are just for better visability.
    To run with visualization:
        add flag --visualize
